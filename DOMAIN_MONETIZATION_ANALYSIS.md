- Create lightweight web UI (SaaS dashboard)
- Integrate Claude API for sophisticated legal reasoning
- Build 2-3 beta features (LLC formation checklist, SAFE agreement explainer, cap table guide)
- Cost: $0-5K (if you build), $10K-30K (if hiring contractor)

**Phase 2 (Months 4-6): MVP Launch & Beta**
